<!-- Your Cheesemongers page -->
John
Prior to my dream job of Cheesemonger, I was working as a Certified Public Accountant at Deloitte & Touche. In search of my professional passion, I quit my job, began to study food, and found myself attracted to cheese. The more that I read, ate, and learned, the more I wanted to keep going. That's when Kendall and I started hosting Grilled Cheese Club events for friends at our house. While the events were designed to revolve around gourmet sandwiches, they quickly devolved into guided cheese tastings and pairings. I began to travel as much as I could, visiting dairies and cheese shops collecting as many samples as possible. I followed that with a trip to France to intern with affineur Herve Mons, and then traveled with Kendall through the Alps stopping whenever we saw a "Fromage" sign. It was an amazing experience. Eventually, with the support and commitment of Kendall, I begin to build our business. Now I am a full-time cheesemonger with part time accounting responsibilities (old habits die hard). I am a member of the Judging and Competition Committee for the American Cheese Society where I help (along with other amazing committee members) plan and manage North America's largest cheese competition. Although job duties sometimes demand otherwise, I have been behind the case since we opened and hope to be there for the rest of my life. 

Favorite Cheese: The one in front of me!
Favorite Pairing: Ossau-Iraty by Onetik with Hennepin by Ommegang
Ideal Cheese Plate: A single cheese – either a perfect Rush Creek, Epoisses, or Vacherin Mont d'Or and a spoon
Dream Trip: Whatever trip takes me to find the next great cheese for our case
Other favorite shop product: Fleur de Sel. Or Tupelo Honey. Or Finocchiona. (I give up. Tough question).
Go to product to evoke customer happy dance: Come in and find out! 
Cheese-y nickname: The Cheese Man
Favorite milk type: Mixed Milk 
If I were a cheese, I'd be: Pleasant Ridge Reserve because I'm a little nutty, a little sweet, a little earthy but always very dependable. 
My favorite thing about being a cheesemonger: Making you smile and hopefully becoming your friend. 
Why I wanted to work at ACS: Because they would hire me.
Other Hobbies: Being with Kendall, eating, talking and traveling. Isn't it great when your job is your hobby?!

Kendall
How does one exactly become a cheesemonger? I'm still asking that question myself. With a Georgetown degree in Culture and Politics and a UT masters degree in Latin American Studies, I was working at a local non-profit running a program for immigrant survivors of crimes like human trafficking. John and I knew we wanted to work together someday. (To be honest, I always thought it would be at my nonprofit!) But after running the cheese club out of our house, I quickly realized it wasn't only John who was becoming obsessed with molds, milks, breeds, producers, and the like. And from there, the rest is history. In a way, it all makes sense. A significant portion of my youth was spent rodeo'ing (yes- even being forced to run for rodeo queen!), showing sheep in 4-H, and occasionally being dragged before sunrise to help my step-father move cattle on his ranch. From watching him, I know exactly how much work goes into maintaining a ranch, caring for your animals, and trying to make a living. (I also know I'm not cut out for it, and therefore quickly nixed any idea of moving to the country to make our own cheese!) By working behind the cheese counter, I can speak to just how much work producers put into their craft. My appreciation and awe for what they do makes every bite of cheese that much more delicious and my excitement for telling you their story that much more important. Years ago, I couldn't have guessed I'd become a cheesemonger, but I'm very proud today to say that I am one. Hope you'll come talk cheese with us! 

Favorite Cheese: Unanswerable, like choosing your favorite child.
Favorite Pairing: Tomme Crayeuse (overly ripe) and summer tomatoes
Ideal Cheese Plate: Bijou, Ossau Iraty, Cabot Clothbound Cheddar, Hopelessly Blue
Dream Trip: Greece. Cheese + Beaches = Bliss
Other favorite shop product: Raclette Machine – with Raclette cheese of course! (And cured meats, cornichons, bread, and tomatoes…)
Go to product to evoke customer happy dance: Creminelli's Salame al Tartufo
Cheese-y nickname: Cheese Ball
Favorite milk type: Blasphemy. Please see answer above about favorite cheese.
If I were a cheese, I'd be: Winnimere because I've always dreamed of being washed in beer, plus I'm firm on the outside but a softie on the inside. 
My favorite thing about being a cheesemonger: Meeting new food-loving friends and watching kiddos grow up on our cheese! 
Why I wanted to work at ACS: I couldn't let John have all the fun for himself.
Other Hobbies: My life is pretty cheese-centric these days.

Kelly
I fell in love with cheese while living in France. It's cliché, I know, but it's the truth. I lived a couple blocks from the Fromagerie Barthelemy in Paris and worked my way through all the cheeses in the shop! Upon returning to the States, I decided that I wanted to do something with cheese and landed a job in the cheese department at Central Market in 2003. That proved to be a wonderful education and also happens to be where I came to know John and Kendall. Along the way I got involved with the American Cheese Society and was honored to be awarded The John Crompton Memorial Scholarship and most recently selected to be The Official Cheesemonger for The American Cheese Socity Conference in Montreal this year. I have spent the past 4 years in charge of Triage during the judging and competition portion of the Conference. When John and Kendall told me of their idea to open a small, specialty cheese shop, I jumped at the chance to be a part of such an exciting venture! I am so happy to help people find the perfect cheeses for any occasion and hopefully introduce them to their new favorites!

Favorite Cheese: Not a fair question! It changes on regular basis.
Favorite pairing: Gioia Burrata with olive oil, dark chocolate balsamic, a little sea salt, and Barrie's ciabatta. Wait, is that a pairing or dinner? It's both.
Ideal Cheese Plate: This changes regularly; today it's Redwood Hill California Crottin, Cobb Hill Ascutney Mountain, and Rogue Creamery Caveman Blue.
Dream Trip: Bra, Italy for the Slow Food Cheese event.
Other favorite shop product: Salumeria Biellese Sopressata Piccante
Go to product to evoke customer happy dance: Blue Heron Farm's Cajeta
Cheese-y-nickname: A lot of people refer to me as cheeselady. 
Favorite milk type: All of them! Well, maybe not Yak.
If I were a cheese, I'd be: Gruyere because I'm versatile.
My favorite thing about being a cheesemonger: Helping people expand their palates!
Why I wanted to work at ACS: To be a part of a small shop where we can really get to know our customers and offer products we really believe in!
Other Hobbies: The usual suspects – Movies, Books, Friends, and Food.

Paul
The first food I remember craving as a child? Cheese. It's always been cheese. Since 2007, I've been behind the cheese case at Zingerman's in Ann Arbor honing my palate. It was my job to taste through seasonal cycle after seasonal cycle of some of the finest cheeses the planet has to offer. I'm obsessed with the bliss factor that only cheese seems to provide. My path in life led me to Antonelli's door in March 2011. I walked in the door and instantly felt the positive energy. Within ten minutes of entering the shop John was already talking with me about a possible job. I was flattered. I met with John and Kendall in June to talk further. So I decided to pack my bags and relocate to your friendly city. I now call Austin home. I'm going to do my best to ensure that Austin is getting only the finest of cheeses. It will by my honor and pleasure to hopefully enrich this community with my love for cheese.

favorite cheese: 20-30 month old Comte
favorite pairing: Cheddar and apples
ideal cheese plate: Fresh Chevre, Comte, and Roquefort 
dream trip: France
other: Askinosie Chocolate
happy dance: Pleasant Ridge Reserve

cheese nick name: Boss Man
milk: Sheep
If I was a cheese, I'd be cheddar because I'm nutty and sharp.
favorite thing about being a cheesemonger: Inducing cheese bliss
Why I wanted to work at ACS: Because it's a family-run shop motivated by supporting traditional artisanal food producers
other hobbies: Art, Music, Wine, Skateboarding.....

Brad
I'm not exactly what you would call a "gourmet." Don't get me
wrong, I enjoy good food and drink as much as the next guy, but I
never really formed a passion for it. Or, more precisely, I hadn't
formed a passion for it until my first visit to Antonelli's a little
after it opened, becoming one of the first 150 customers (who let John
and Kendall record their purchase in the Cheese Logs). Before that
first experience with real, actual cheese, I had no idea how diverse
and even outright strange (though entirely wonderful) this once
seemingly simple subsection of the dairy category could be. I've found
that my appreciation for the tastes and textures of cheese mirror my
taste in music: I love the romantic and refined beauty of opera and
Beethoven, as well as the unbridled ferocity and raw emotion of thrash
metal. Similarly, I savor and have a real appreciation for the milder,
subtler cheeses that seem to caress your taste buds just as much as
stronger, more complex, and pungent cheeses that dropkick your entire
olfactory system.

Favorite Cheese: Fresh Brebis
Favorite Pairing: Blue cheese and Blue Heron Farm cajeta
Ideal Cheese Plate: The one that's in front of me.
Dream Trip: Whirlwind cheese tour of Spain, Italy, and France
Other favorite shop product: Salumi!
Go to product to evoke customer happy dance: Abbaye de Belloc
Cheese-y nickname: The Mongerel
Favorite milk type: Sheep
If I were a cheese, I'd be EATEN because I'm DELICIOUS.
 My favorite thing about being a cheesemonger: Let's be honest - it's
the discount.
Why I wanted to work at ACS: It's the place where I fell in love with cheese.
Other Hobbies: Pretending to be a writer.

Shawn
If you were to walk into my kitchen at any time there are a few things you would always find: Great Cheese, Crusty Bread and Fine Wine. My friends always joke that I cannot show up to someone's house without bringing some new taste I want to share with them. My passion doesn't have a concrete beginning but working in coffee shops as a teenager taught me to stop and savor what I was eating. As I grew up, I realized how closely related culture and food are. Want to get to know someone from a different background than you? Sit down at their dinner table and eat what they eat. After living in France for a year and eating at as many tables as I could throughout Europe, I realized my passion for food was more than just a hobby. I spent my time in France refining my cooking skills with my neighbors and getting on a first name basis with my local cheesemonger and wine guy. They taught me how to pick and serve a ripe Camembert, how to choose a good Cab Franc, and how eating is more than nourishment; it is a cultural tradition that every single person builds throughout their life and is influenced by everyone they meet. After returning from France I found the Antonelli's were passionate in the same way. Now I get to be part of a community that wants to share good food. I love growing my knowledge of cheese everyday and am a certified executive wine sommelier. Come in and ask me what I'm excited about today! I'll give you some great samples, suggest some beautiful wine and you will leave with the makings of a great evening.

Favorite Cheese: Camembert
Favorite Pairing: Dry Cider, Camembert, Grilled pork steak
Ideal Cheese Plate: Camembert, Fiore Sardo, Roquefort
Dream Trip: One Month, a Rental car, Round trip tickets to Paris, a map of France
Other favorite shop product: Marcona Almonds evoke
Go to product to evoke customer happy dance: June's Joy
Cheese-y nickname: The Lactic Wonder
Favorite milk type: Raw Cow
If I were a cheese, I'd be Fourme d'Ambert because I'm complex and gamey, with a funky sweet side. 
My favorite thing about being a cheesemonger: Meeting new people and sharing new flavors
Why I wanted to work at ACS: To get an opportunity to touch and taste a vast array of delicious products.
Other Hobbies: Cooking, Reading, Cycling, Traveling, Underwater Basket Weaving

Courtney
My passion for cheese has grown with my passion for beer. My Dad
began brewing when I was about seven years of age, so it doesn't make
it difficult to understand why I started brewing about a year and a
half ago. The homebrew store in Austin also happened to sell
cheesemaking kits and the ball started rolling from there. In pursuit
of expanding my knowledge of cheese, I took a cheese making workshop with Pure Luck Dairy in Dripping Springs in January 2011 and have been making
basket chevre anytime I get the chance ever since. I am thoroughly
excited to be apart of the team and cannot wait to help you friendly
folks with some cheese and beer pairings. Cheers and see you soon!

Favorite Cheese: Vermont Butter and Cheese Co. Coupole
Favorite Pairing: Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout with Rogue Creamery
Caveman Blue
Ideal Cheese Plate: All goat's milk cheeses, including Coupole, Kunik, Chevre d'Or, Chevre Noir, and Montenebro. I'd also want an abundance of duck salami, speck and petite jesu, along with an assortment of berries, blackberries, raspberries and Strawberries, some pistachios, and Barrie's bread (of course)!
Dream Trip: A U.S. brewery road trip with a trunk full of cheese to
pair along the way.
Other favorite shop product: Laguiole Bread knife
Go to product to evoke customer happy dance: Widmers 10 Year Cheddar with our Shallot Confit
Cheese-y nickname: Cheese Mongol
Favorite milk type: I'd hate to be bias when it comes to cheese
because I love it all but I'm obviously a sucker for the Goat. By the looks of
my ideal cheese plate, I think I gave myself away with that one.
If I were a cheese, I'd be triple creme because everyone loves a good
triple creme.
My favorite thing about being a cheesemonger: Figuring out peoples
palates and giving them a taste of something that they'll love.
Why I wanted to work at ACS: To try lots of different cheeses and have the opportunity to collaborate on beer and cheese pairing events
Other Hobbies: Brewing beer, making cheese, gardening, cooking and
collecting VHS tapes

	<p>Two years after John announced on our honeymoon that he wanted to quit his job and "do something in cheese," we unlocked the front door to our very own cheese shop on February 11, 2010. We've been asked many times since, "Why a Cheese Shop?" and the answer is simple. After putting ourselves through cheese bootcamps, running a cheese club out of our house, attending cheese conferences, interning for affineur Herve Mons, journeying through Europe, and eating our way through thousands of tasty cheese morsels, we honed in on our true passions: eating, talking, traveling, and spending time together. Over a bottle of wine one evening, we realized that working behind a cheese case would bring them all together.</p>
	<p>Ignoring all evidence of a down economy we went for it. The result is our cheese shop where we focus on sourcing the finest artisanal cheese and providing cut to order service in a relaxed, "taste before you buy" environment. Nestled into historic Hyde Park, our business has since grown to include a Cheese House. While the Cheese Shop remains our dedicated retail space, our Cheese House, located directly across the street, allows us to better serve the growing demand by our restaurant partners and customers for more cheese education.</p>
	<p>While you're visiting our website, you'll find many photos of the products we offer. Unfortunately you cannot taste them through the computer. So come by the shop and let our passionate team of cheesemongers do what they do best: guide you through the case sharing the stories of their favorite products and offering small tastes to make you smile. We hope to see you soon.</p>

<ul class="accordion">

	<li class="question">What is a cheese shop? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>Cheese shops come in all shapes and sizes with different approaches to service and techniques, but they all have a couple things in common: an emphasis on quality and a passion for cheese. Shops of this kind fill the same role as your local baker or butcher who provide expert service in a very niche product category. At our shop, the focus is on sourcing the best cheese that we can and getting it to you at its peak, as the producers had intended. Further, because cheese is at the core of every decision we make, all of the products that we sell are directly related to the cheese in the case either as pairings, for serving, or gift ideas. If you're still not sure what a cheese shop is, come in and meet our cheesemongers. They will be happy to guide you through the shop and let you taste some of the products that we feature.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">What is a cheesemonger? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>Urban Dictionary defines a cheesemonger as a "vendor of cheese or indeed purveyor of interesting ideas." While we cannot confirm the second half of the definition, the first part is pretty spot on. Our job title conveys a sense of confidence and immediate trust to our customers. Cheesemongers cut their teeth behind counters all across the world and learn from their predecessors about the care, taste, histories and lives of the wheels of cheese they sell. We are passionate about cheese and we strive to share that passion each day we arrive to work. </p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">What products do you carry? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>We feature a rotating selection of domestic and imported artisanal cheeses, charcuterie, craft beer and boutique wine by the bottle, and other delectable pairings like chocolates, nuts, preserves, honey, vinegars and oils, olives, and freshly-baked bread, as well as the serving boards and cheese knives needed to showcase them.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">What are your Hours of Operation? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>We are open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 11am to 7pm and on Sundays from Noon to 5pm. Note that we are closed on Mondays. Please check with the shop regarding special hours during holidays.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">Where are you located? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>The Cheese Shop is located at 4220 Duval Street, Austin, TX 78751 nestled between Hyde Park Bar & Grill and Dolce Vita in the Duval Center of the historic Hyde Park neighborhood in North Central Austin. (Note: If you enter this into a GPS, make sure to put Duval Street because Duval Road will take you to NW Austin!) Our Cheese House is directly across the street at 500 Park Blvd, Austin TX 78751.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">What is the best way to contact you? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>We can be reached by email at <a href="mailto:info@antonellischeese.com">info@antonellischeese.com</a> or by calling the shop at (512)531-9610. Please note that we are often cheesemongering behind the counter and unable to check email consistently; however, we will get back to you as quickly as we can.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">Are you hiring? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>We are a small team of dedicated cheesemongers and, unfortunately, there are not many positions available at our shop; however, we are always looking for passionate, cheese-obsessed individuals. For more information or to check if we have any openings, please refer to our <a href="/employment">Employment</a> page.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">What does "fresh cut to order" mean? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>Cheese is a living thing, and as soon as a wheel is cut into, its vitality begins to decline. Cutting fresh to order ensures freshness, preserves flavor, and minimizes waste. We offer cheese in bulk format so that you can peruse our selection and taste before you choose, purchasing only what you need. This also means that the open face of our cheese never lies under plastic wrap for a significant period of time. Cheese needs air to breath and live and after too much time in plastic wrap it has a bad habit of picking up that nasty plasticky flavor. Equally important as ensuring freshness, cutting to order also allows us to provide you with just the right amount of cheese that you need. While most customers purchase between three to five ounces, it is not uncommon for guests to purchase one pound or even one ounce of a particular product. Ask the cheesemongers for advice and they can guide you to perfect amount to fit your needs (because no leftover cheese should go to die in your refrigerator!).</p>

	<li class="question">Do you have parking? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>We have two reserved parking spaces in front of the Cheese Shop as well as seven additional parking spaces located directly across the street at the Cheese House.</p>

	<li class="question">Do you have table service? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>We are retail only and do not have any tables or table service in our store. However, we can suggest amazing outdoor locations throughout Austin to enjoy your goodies.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">Can we really sample as we go? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>Complimentary sampling is an important part of the Antonelli's Cheese Shop experience. We hope that by sampling our products, you will be 100% satisfied even before you have to spend a penny. Moreover, the taste of artisanal cheese can change depending on a number of variables, including seasonality. We want to help you try new cheeses (without the commitment of buying them first!), as well as make sure your favorites are tasting just the way you like them.</p>

	<li class="question">How should I keep track of the cheese that I buy so I can have a reference? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>At the end of your very first visit to the Cheese Shop, our cheesemongers will ask if you'd like us to create a Cheese Log. This service allows us to track all of your purchases under your name so that you can refer back to it upon future visits. That way you never forget that yellowish round cheese that was semi-soft and tasted of butter.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">Do you sell raw milk cheese? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>Yes. The regulations pertaining to raw milk cheese are different from those pertaining to the sale of raw milk. It is legal to sell raw milk cheese in the United States, as long as it is aged over sixty days – regardless of whether it is domestic or imported. (Alternatively, we cannot legally sell raw milk cheeses younger than sixty days.) Approximately 40% of the cheese that we carry is made from raw milk. Next time you're in the shop, ask one of the cheesemongers for some assistance in identifying either the raw or pasteurized products, depending on your needs and preferences.</p>

	<li class="question">I want to relax and enjoy a great cheese plate. Where can I do that? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>We work with many chefs around Austin to offer a variety of unique cheese plates that change on a rotating basis.

	<li class="question">Do you host private party tastings or private events? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>Bringing cheese into people's lives, be it through special celebrations or corporate functions, is certainly a job perk. We offer a number of different options in our space, based on your needs and our involvement. For an in-depth, educational experience, we offer a Guided Tasting, which can cover a variety of themes; our most demanded Guided Tasting is our "Cheese 101: 7 Styles of Cheese Class." In addition to cheese, Guided Tastings also include nuts, olives, bread, pairings, and complimentary wine pairings. If you're looking for something a bit more casual and less time consuming, we also offer a Cheese Social Hour, which includes a tasting of four different cheeses, as well as four complimentary pairings. Lastly, you can choose simply to rent our space for a meeting or other function (and we're happy to put out a cheese platter at an additional cost, if requested).

<!-- General Cheese page -->
<p>Our goal is to provide you with a diverse selection of artisanal cheese, both domestic and imported. We strive o source unique products and get them onto your plates at their prime (or a little younger if your party is a few days away). When you step into the shop, the wonderfully-stinky aromas will fill your nose and the large cheese case piled high with glorious wedges will catch your eyes. For many, it takes their breath away (especially kids who plug their noses). Don't be intimidated though, because you'll promptly be greeted by a cheesemonger, who will in turn serve as your personal guide throughout your entire experience.</p>
<p>It is our job as cheesemongers to introduce you to the cheese case, which is arranged in the seven styles of cheese. We hope that our dedicated service makes cheese-buying both approachable and educational. The personal service also enables our cheesemongers to guide you through a tasting to better find what suits your palate at that particular moment. Sampling and tasting is an integral part of the experience we offer you, giving you a deep understanding of what you are purchasing. We also regularly rotate our cheese selection, and your cheesemonger can point you towards new, amazing products or help you find alternatives to your old favorites. Moreover, our cut-fresh-to-order service helps you get cheese straight from the wheel, at its peak, and in the exact amount you need. At the end of your first visit to the Cheese Shop, our cheesemongers will ask if you'd like us to create a Cheese Log. This service allows us to track all of your purchases under your name so that you can refer back to it upon future visits. That way you never forget that yellowish round cheese that was semi-soft and tasted of butter.</p>
<p>We're often asked how we decide which cheeses to feature in our case? The answer is simple: We eat! We taste! We research! We travel when possible. We visit cheese producers at their dairies and farms to see what new projects they have up their sleeves. We actively participate in the American Cheese Society and collaborate with other cheese-centric groups. Of course, we also take into consideration the need for diversity in milk types, cheese styles, and geographic origin. And ultimately, we choose products we like to eat ourselves. Simple. </p>
<p>If you are looking for a particular product, please give the shop a call to ask a cheesemonger. Hoping to place a special order for a cheese we don't currently have in stock? Email us to see if it's a possibility. Most importantly, come visit us and taste! Our hope is to continue to provide you with new favorites and keep you coming back for more.</p>

<!-- Texas Cheese page -->
<p>Yes! Texas Cheese! We proudly offer a rotating selection of cheeses from many of the Texan producers on the map above. From the goat cheese producers of the hill country to the cow milk producers of the flatlands, a plethora of producers have come onto the cheesemaking scene in the past decade (and a few are even older). At the 2011 American Cheese Society annual conference and competition, six Texas cheese and dairy producers brought home a total of thirteen ribbons! (And it's worth noting that not every producer even entered into the competition.) We are excited and honored to represent Texas cheese in our case, and we look forward to what the next decade has in store. (Unfortunately, we are not able to stock cheeses from every producer, so call ahead if you're looking for something particular.)</p>

<!-- Charcouterie page -->
<div class="column half-page left">
	<p>In simple terms, charcuterie is the preservation of meat products, traditionally referring to pork. At our shop, we focus on charcuterie producers who use meat from humanely raised animals and who employ traditional handcrafted practices. Ranging from salami to prosciutto to lardo, we offer ready-to-eat products perfect for any antipasti or charcuterie platter.</p>
	<p>In our meat case, we have featured domestically-produced charcuterie from Salumeria Biellese (New York), Creminelli Fine Meats (Utah), La Quercia (Iowa), Fra'Mani (California), Niman Ranch (California), and Columbus Salami Co. (California), among others, as well as a handful of imported products like Italian Prosciutto. If you are looking for something particular, please call the shop to ask a cheesemonger.</p>

<!-- Cheese FAQs page -->
<ul class="accordion">

	<li class="question">How many styles of cheese are there? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>There are countless ways to classify cheese. We've adapted our categories from others and presented them in the way we think works best. At Antonelli's Cheese Shop, we group cheese into seven major styles, according to the most defining characteristic of a cheese. (Note that in many cases a cheese can be categorized in more than one style due to numerous variables including maturation and mold influences.)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fresh: rindless cheeses meant to be consumed in a short period of time [ex. ricotta, fresh chevre, fresh mozzarella]</li>
			<li>Soft-Ripened/Bloomy Rind: generally cheese with a Penicillium Camemberti or Geotrichum Candidum white molded rind [ex. Brie, Bonne Bouche, Humboldt Fog]</li>
			<li>Washed Rind: orange-colored, wet-looking cheese with a distinct aroma and flavor due to the presence of Brevibacterium linens, a result of regular washing in a brine or other solution [ex. Epoisses, Red Hawk, Munster]</li>
			<li>Semi-Soft: pliable in texture, great melters [ex. Tomme Crayeuse, Fontina, Menage]</li>
			<li>Firm: dry, yet smooth paste that cracks when bent [ex. Comte, Pleasant Ridge Reserve, Cabot Clothbound Cheddar]</li>
			<li>Hard: driest cheese that crumbles and shatters when broken [ex. Parmigiano Reggiano, aged Gouda]</li>
			<li>Blue: cheese with pencillium roqueforti in it; often has visual blue veins or coloring [ex. Rogue River Blue, Roquefort, Gorgonzola]</li>
		</ul>
		<p>It's important to re-iterate that there is no definitive way to separate cheese into styles. This is, however, the method that we found to be the most convenient when helping us group cheese by major characteristics, as well as in helping guide us to finding a cheese to fit your mood or purpose.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">What are the differences between milk types? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>Trying to define all cheeses as having a same flavor profile is impossible, due to the sheer quantity, as well as variances in animal breed type, animal diet, seasonality, maturation, and terroir (loosely meaning the specific environment of a place, like climate, soil, altitude, etcetera that cannot be exactly replicated anywhere else). However, flavor profiles of the milk types are often described as follows: Cheese from Cow's milk has the greatest diversity in flavor resulting from the large variety of vegetation consumed by the animals during summer months. Most generally, it's thought to be buttery, grassy, and sometimes sweet. Cheese made from Goat's milk is characteristically tangy and acidic. Cheese made from Sheep's milk has a rich, nutty, oily quality about them. Finally, cheese made form Water Buffalo's milk has a wet hay, lactic flavor profile.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">What does artisanal mean? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>Quite the buzz word these days, folks throw "artisanal" around to mean a lot of different things. At the cheese shop, we use it to distinguish "cheese that's been touched by hands." In other words, "artisanal cheese" requires a bit of science and a good deal of artistry as the cheesemaker tries to adapt cheese making procedures to fit the particular batch of milk instead of making the milk always fit the particular procedures of the making. (This is not to say that industrial is bad; indeed, they're not necessarily opposites.) Just know that when we say we focus on sourcing "artisanal cheese," we're looking for cheeses that have taken a good deal of human labor to create and that can be traced to cheesemakers and the milk source.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">What does farmstead mean? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>A "farmstead cheese" is one that is made on a farm that also cares for its own animals, often meaning that the same group of folks who take care of the animals also make the cheese and that the milk doesn't have to travel far or sit long before being made into cheese.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">Why does cutting to order make such a difference? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>Cheese is a living thing, and as soon as a wheel is cut into, its vitality begins to decline. Cutting fresh to order ensures freshness, preserves flavor, and minimizes waste. We offer cheese in bulk format so that you can peruse our selection and taste before you choose, purchasing only what you need. This also means that the open face of our cheese never lies under plastic wrap for a significant period of time. Cheese needs air to breath and live and after too much time in plastic wrap it has a bad habit of picking up that nasty plasticky flavor. Equally important as ensuring freshness, cutting to order also allows us to provide you with just the right amount of cheese that you need. While most customers purchase between three to five ounces, it is not uncommon for guests to purchase one pound or even one ounce of a particular product. Ask the cheesemongers for advice and they can guide you to perfect amount to fit your needs (because no leftover cheese should go to die in your refrigerator!).</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">What is the best way to serve cheese? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>To fully experience all of the aromas and nuanced flavors a cheese has to offer, it's important let the product come to room temperature (since cold refrigeration often masks flavors). Depending on the style and ripeness, take your cheese out at least 45 minutes to an hour before serving. (Keep in mind that room temperature generally means about 65 degrees; it does not mean Texas summer hot!) It's also important to put a separate cheese knife out for each wedge of cheese, so that flavors and molds don't mix resulting in an off putting flavor. Lastly, if you're serving your cheese in big, beautiful chunks, it's always a good idea to slice the first piece or two; this sets an example for your guests, so that they know how to go about cutting the remainder.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">Do you have any pairing advice? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>Have fun with pairing! It's easy to opt for classic choices like fresh fruit, nuts, olives, preserves, or honey. However, it's often fun to be more adventurous and use savory pairings (like a shallot confit or tomato jam), an assortment of chocolates, mustardos, or charcuterie. You can also ask a cheesemonger. A lot of pairing technique depends on the particular cheese that you choose, so come in and chat with us; we'll assist with your selection and then help find the perfect, creative pairing. (And we always have wine, beer, and other beverage pairing advice. We've even paired with teas, coffees, and sodas!)</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">What is the best way to store a cut piece of cheese? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>Depending on the type of cheese that you have, there are a number of ways you can store your cheese in order to maintain the quality and flavor. First and foremost, we always suggest buying only what you'll use within a week's time. Sure, cheese can last longer, but it does lose its nuance and takes on "fridge funk flavor" the longer it's stored in your fridge. That being said, here are a few suggestions to assist in caring for your cheese:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>re-use our cheese paper which is designed to allow the cheese to breath and live until it is soiled.</li>
			<li>Place the cheese in a Tupperware container along with a damp paper towel to keep the humidity high. If you go this route, remember to freshen the air inside every other day to ensure that the cheese can breathe.</li>
			<li>Wrap cheese in wax paper or aluminum foil (for blue cheese) and loosely wrap in plastic. Make sure that the cheese does not directly touch the plastic as off flavors may seep into the cheese.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li class="question">What is lactose intolerance? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>One of the most repeated comments we hear behind the cheese counter is "I wish I could have that, but I'm lactose intolerant." We have good news if that is your situation! The process of making cheese involves converting lactose into lactic acid. Although there are small amounts of lactose in fresh cheeses, as cheese matures almost all of the remaining lactose is converted to lactic acid by the cultures that are thriving within the paste of the cheese. Because of this, we often suggest that you try cheeses from the firm and hard categories to see how they affect you. Of course, we are not doctors; we are just cheesemongers trying to stop the spread of intolerance against cheese. So it is up to you to experiment.</p>
	</li>

	<li class="question">I'm pregnant, what cheese can I eat? <a href="#" class="more" onclick="return false;">Answer &raquo;</a></li>
	<li class="answer">
		<p>Cheesemongers are often the first people to find out about a pregnancy. Women looking for only pasteurized hard cheeses are a dead give away. Others are unsure about what cheeses are permitted during pregnancy and whisper over the counter for our guidance. Here's our disclaimer: we're cheesemongers, not doctors. So at the end of the day, follow your doctor's advice. Opinions differ, so if you do not like the advice of your current doctor, switch. Or stick to your doctor and tell your husband to pre-order a gift basket to be delivered to the hospital only hours after giving birth. (It won't be the first time we see a daddy with his hospital bracelet on.)</p>

<!-- Cheese Classes page -->
<p>We love talking cheese; it's one of the best aspects of our jobs! Therefore, we regularly offer in store classes, in which our cheesemongers will be your guides for the evening sharing stories, histories, and lots and lots of cheese samples. Accompaniments include bread, olives, and nuts, as well as complimentary beverage tastings. At the end of the class, we get behind the case to provide you with a personal cheesemongering experience, sampling items mentioned during class and cutting and selling products so you can recreate the evening at home with your friends.</p>
<p>We currently announce our class schedule at the end of each month in our weekly emailed newsletters, and classes usually sell out within the hour. (Note that we are working on an online purchasing system and will hopefully have updates soon.) Each class is $30 per person (plus tax). You must call (531-9610) or drop by and speak to a cheesemonger to reserve your spot with a credit card, and you may only sign up for a maximum of 4 seats. (If your party is larger, contact us for information on <a href="/private-party-tastings">private parties and tastings</a>.) An RSVP is considered as a seat purchase and cancellations must still be paid in full.</p>
<p>See <a href="/calendar-events">calendar of events</a> for future scheduled classes.</p>

<!-- Prepared Platters page -->
<p>Sometimes you need a break! Or you find out last minute that you're hosting a group tomorrow and need a quick snack. Or simply, you like to treat yourself once in awhile. Our composed cheese platters are perfect for you. Our cheesemongers will select the products based on tastes, presentation and how well they compliment one another. Because of the artisanal nature of our products we are unable to guarantee any specific cheeses in advance. A general pricing list for our cheese and meat platters (which include nuts) follows. Upon request, we can substitute olives for meat.</p>

<!-- Picnic Basket Rental page -->
<p>Cheese, charcuterie, bread and wine. All that is missing is a picnic blanket. Rent one of our fully-loaded picnic baskets, complete with serving ware, dishes, and a corkscrew. The basket includes five cheeses, two meats, wine or beer, bread, nuts, and a dessert treat. The cost is $75 and a deposit is required upon reservation for the basket. Consider this your best chance of attaining the "perfect date." Please call the shop to order and specify whether you'd like wine or beer included in the basket.</p>

<!-- Private Party Tastings page -->
<p>We love making cheese (and ourselves) the center of attention. To that end, we offer a number of different private event options in our space, based on your needs and our involvement. For an in-depth, educational experience, we offer a Guided Tasting, which can cover a variety of themes; our most demanded Guided Tasting is our "Cheese 101: 7 Styles of Cheese" class. If you're looking for something a bit more casual and less time consuming, we also offer a Cheese Social Hour, which includes a tasting of four different cheeses, with four complimentary pairings. Lastly, you can choose simply to rent our space for a meeting or celebration (and we're happy to put out a <a href="/prepared-platters">cheese platter</a> at an additional cost). For more details, email <a href="mailto:catering@antonellischeese.com">catering@antonellischeese.com</a>.</p>

<p><h2 style="margin-bottom:0;">Gift Baskets</h2>The following are some of our cheesemonger favorites. Consider giving one of these or using them as a springboard to create something else:</p>

<p class="basket-description"><span class="basket-label">Texas Trio $40:</span> This flavor of Texas basket includes an assortment of three cheeses produced by our Texan Cheesemakers, including Brazos Valley Cheese, CKC Farms, Eagle Mountain Farmhouse Cheese, Pure Luck Dairy, Sand Creek Farm, and Veldhuizen Family Farm. Either Blue Heron Farm's Cajeta (goat milk caramel) or Confituras preserves are included to pair with the cheese.</p>

<p class="basket-quote">Cheesemonger Courtney: "This is my go-to hostess gift to bring to a party because everyone loves hearing about our local producers."</p>

<p class="basket-description"><span class="basket-label">Addicted to Breed $30:</span> Know your friend is allergic to the proteins in cow's milk? Or does she dislike the tanginess of goat milk cheeses? This basket includes an assortment of three milk-specific cheeses in various styles.</p>

<p class="basket-quote">Cheesemonger Kelly: "This has been a great gift for new breast-feeding mom's who are excited to eat cheese again but have to stay away from cow's milk. So I'll treat them to all sheep or goat milk cheeses."</p>

<p class="basket-description"><span class="basket-label">Country Specific $35:</span> This is the ideal gift for someone heading off to a new country or for those who've just returned and can't get enough. Consider a French, Italian, or Spanish centric selection of three cheeses with regional accompaniments.</p>

<p class="basket-quote">Cheesemonger Shawn: "I selected this for my wife to remind her of our time in France. When we ate it, we were transported back to that wonderful year."</p>
